- **Detailed validation** of network topology, IP assignment, and communication
- **JSON reporting** with comprehensive analysis and recommendations

### 2. Test Runner (`scripts/run_hierarchical_addressing_test.py`)
- **250+ lines** of runner code with analysis capabilities
- **Multiple execution modes**: full test, analysis-only, skip-setup

## Test Architecture

### Network Topology Tested
The test suite is designed to validate the global 20-agent configuration with:

- **5 Autonomous Systems (AS)**:

  - AS 65002: Europe (192.168.0.0/24) - 4 agents
  - AS 65003: Asia (172.16.0.0/24) - 6 agents
  - AS 65004: South America (10.1.0.0/24) - 3 agents
  - AS 65005: Africa (10.2.0.0/24) - 2 agents

## Usage Examples

### Basic Test Execution
```bash
# Run complete test suite
python3 scripts/run_hierarchical_addressing_test.py

# Skip environment setup
python3 scripts/run_hierarchical_addressing_test.py --skip-setup

# Analysis only mode
python3 scripts/run_hierarchical_addressing_test.py --analyze-only
```

### Direct Test Execution
```bash
# Run with debug logging
python3 scripts/test_hierarchical_addressing.py --log-level DEBUG

# JSON output format
python3 scripts/test_hierarchical_addressing.py --output-format json
```

## Integration with Simulation Workflow

The test suite integrates seamlessly with the existing Monerosim workflow:

1. **Configuration**: Uses `config_global_20_agents.yaml`
2. **Topology**: Validates `global_network_20_nodes_no_comments.gml`
3. **Shadow Generation**: Compatible with existing build process
4. **Simulation Execution**: Works with standard Shadow simulation runs
5. **Result Analysis**: Provides post-simulation validation

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- **Python 3.6+** with standard library modules
- **Existing Monerosim modules**: error_handling, monero_rpc
- **File-based communication** via shared directories
- **JSON configuration** and reporting

### Architecture Patterns
- **Modular design** with clear separation of concerns
- **Factory pattern** for test case creation
- **Observer pattern** for result collection
- **Strategy pattern** for different analysis methods

### Performance Characteristics
- **Lightweight execution**: Minimal resource requirements
- **Fast analysis**: Sub-second execution for most tests
- **Scalable design**: Can handle larger network topologies
- **Memory efficient**: Low memory footprint

## Validation Results

The test framework has been validated to:

✅ **Load and parse** GML network topologies correctly
✅ **Extract AS information** from network configurations
✅ **Validate IP address assignments** based on AS membership
✅ **Generate comprehensive reports** with actionable insights

2. **Performance benchmarking** across different network sizes
3. **Automated regression testing** for network changes
4. **Visualization tools** for network topology analysis
5. **Integration with CI/CD** pipelines

### Scalability Improvements
1. **Parallel test execution** for large networks
2. **Distributed testing** across multiple nodes
3. **Incremental testing** for configuration changes
4. **Historical trend analysis** of network performance
