# Small-Scale Agent Simulation Test Results

## Test Configuration
- Duration: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Regular users: 10
- Marketplaces: 2
- Mining pools: 2
- Total hosts: 16

## Successes

### 1. Agent Framework
✅ All agents successfully initialized and connected to their RPC services
✅ Fixed RPC connection issue by passing host IP addresses correctly
✅ 15 agents successfully started their main loops

### 2. Wallet Creation
✅ All regular users created wallets successfully
✅ Wallet addresses were generated for all users
✅ Marketplaces created their receiving wallets

### 3. Shared State Communication
✅ Mining pools registered in shared state
✅ Marketplaces registered and published their addresses
✅ Block controller successfully found and coordinated mining pools

### 4. Mining Coordination
✅ Block controller sent start/stop signals to mining pools
✅ Mining pools received and responded to signals
✅ Coordination between pools worked (alternating between poolalpha and poolbeta)

## Issues Identified

### 1. Mining RPC Methods
❌ The `start_mining`, `stop_mining`, and `mining_status` RPC methods returned "Method not found" errors
- This prevented actual block generation
- Without blocks being mined, users had no balance to send transactions

### 2. No Transactions
❌ No transactions were sent during the simulation
- This was expected since users had no balance (no mining rewards)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Mining Issue**: 
   - Option A: Use a different approach for mining (e.g., direct monerod command line flags)
   - Option B: Check if the Monero build has mining RPC enabled
   - Option C: Use a pre-funded testnet configuration

2. **Pre-fund Wallets**:
   - Consider starting with pre-funded wallets for testing transactions
   - Or ensure mining works first to generate funds

3. **Verify Monero Build**:
   - Check if the Monero daemon was built with mining support
   - Verify RPC method names match the daemon version

## Conclusion

The agent-based architecture is working correctly:
- Agents can connect to and control their Monero processes
- The coordination mechanism through shared state files works
- The block controller can orchestrate mining pools

The main blocker is the mining functionality, which appears to be a configuration or build issue with the Monero daemon rather than an agent framework issue.
