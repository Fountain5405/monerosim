Simulation Overview:
  Number of nodes analyzed: 53
  Total blocks mined: 104
  Total unique transactions created: 69
  Total transactions included in blocks: 67

Success Criteria Results:

  • Blocks Created: PASS
    104 blocks mined

  • Blocks Propagated: PASS
    50 user nodes received blocks

  • Transactions Created Broadcast: FAIL
    Transactions not properly created or propagated

  • Transactions In Blocks: FAIL
    67/69 transactions included in blocks

Overall Result:
  FAILURE

Recommendations:
  • Check network connectivity between nodes
  • Verify mining configuration
  • Ensure transaction broadcasting is working
  • Check block propagation timing
