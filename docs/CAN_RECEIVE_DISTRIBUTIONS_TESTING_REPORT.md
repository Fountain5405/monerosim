## Test Configuration

### Test Configuration File

The `config_agents_miner_distributor_test.yaml` file includes:

1. **Agents with Various can_receive_distributions Values**:
   - Agents with `can_receive_distributions: "true"`
   - Agents with `can_receive_distributions: "false"`
   - Agents with `can_receive_distributions: "1"`
   - Agents with `can_receive_distributions: "0"`
   - Agents with `can_receive_distributions: "yes"`
   - Agents with `can_receive_distributions: "no"`
   - Agents without the attribute (default behavior)

2. **Agent Types**:
   - Miners with `is_miner: true`
   - Regular users with various transaction parameters
   - Pure script agents for monitoring

3. **Boolean Format Testing**:
   - String format: "true", "false"
   - Numeric format: "1", "0"
   - Affirmative format: "yes", "no", "on", "off"

## Test Runner Features

### Command Line Options

The test runner script (`scripts/test_can_receive_distributions_runner.py`) supports:

1. **Category Selection**:
   - `--category unit`: Run only unit tests
   - `--category integration`: Run only integration tests
   - `--category consistency`: Run only consistency tests
   - `--category legacy`: Run only legacy tests
   - `--category all`: Run all tests (default)

2. **Output Options**:
   - Colored output for better readability
   - Detailed test execution logs
   - JSON report generation

### Reporting

The test runner generates:

1. **Console Output**:
   - Real-time test execution status
   - Colored pass/fail indicators
   - Execution time for each test
   - Summary statistics

2. **JSON Report** (`can_receive_distributions_test_report.json`):
   - Detailed test results
   - Execution times
   - Error messages (if any)
   - Summary statistics

## Key Testing Scenarios

### 1. Boolean Parsing

Both implementations are tested for consistent parsing of:
- **True Values**: "true", "True", "TRUE", "1", "yes", "YES", "on", "ON"
- **False Values**: "false", "False", "FALSE", "0", "no", "NO", "off", "OFF"
- **Edge Cases**: Empty strings, None values, invalid values

### 2. Recipient Selection

The recipient selection logic is tested for:
- **Normal Operation**: Selecting from distribution-enabled recipients
- **Fallback Behavior**: Using all wallet agents when no distribution-enabled agents exist
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing agent registry or no wallet agents

### 3. Caching Behavior

The AgentDiscovery caching mechanism is tested for:
- **Cache Hit**: Returning cached results when valid
- **Cache Miss**: Refreshing cache when expired or forced
- **Cache Invalidation**: Proper handling of force refresh requests

### 4. Integration Scenarios

Various integration scenarios are tested:
- **All Agents Enabled**: All agents can receive distributions
- **Mixed Values**: Some agents can receive distributions, others cannot
- **No Agents Enabled**: Fallback to all wallet agents
- **No Wallet Agents**: Graceful handling of empty recipient pool
