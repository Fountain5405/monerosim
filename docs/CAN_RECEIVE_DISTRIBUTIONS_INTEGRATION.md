# can_receive_distributions Attribute Integration Guide

## Overview

This document describes the integration of the `can_receive_distributions` attribute into the Monerosim agent system. This attribute provides fine-grained control over which agents can receive mining distributions from the Miner Distributor Agent.

## Purpose

The `can_receive_distributions` attribute enables researchers to:

1. **Control Reward Distribution**: Selectively distribute mining rewards to specific agents
2. **Model Economic Scenarios**: Create simulations with different reward distribution models
3. **Study Network Effects**: Analyze how restricted reward distribution affects network behavior
4. **Test Attack Scenarios**: Simulate scenarios where certain agents are excluded from rewards

## Integration Architecture

### Configuration System Integration

The attribute is integrated into the configuration system at multiple levels:

1. **YAML Configuration**: Added as an optional attribute in agent configurations
2. **Configuration Parser**: Extended to parse and validate the attribute
3. **Agent Registry**: Includes the attribute in the agent registry JSON
4. **Agent Discovery**: Filters agents based on the attribute value

### Data Flow

```
YAML Configuration → Configuration Parser → Agent Registry → Agent Discovery → Miner Distributor
```

## Configuration Usage

### Basic Syntax

The `can_receive_distributions` attribute is specified in the agent's attributes section:

```yaml
agents:
  user_agents:
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      user_script: "agents.regular_user"
      attributes:
        transaction_interval: "60"
        min_transaction_amount: "0.5"
        max_transaction_amount: "2.0"
        can_receive_distributions: true
```

### Supported Values

The attribute supports multiple boolean formats:

| Format | True Values | False Values |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Boolean | `true`, `false` | `true`, `false` |
| String | `"true"`, `"1"`, `"yes"`, `"on"` | `"false"`, `"0"`, `"no"`, `"off"` |

### Default Behavior

- If not specified, agents default to `can_receive_distributions: false`
- This ensures explicit control over distribution recipients
- Fallback mechanism ensures simulations continue to work when no agents are enabled

## Example Configurations

### Small Scale Example

```yaml
# config_agents_small.yaml
agents:
  user_agents:
    # Miner that can receive distributions
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      is_miner: true
      attributes:
        hashrate: "60"
        can_receive_distributions: true

    # Miner that cannot receive distributions
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      is_miner: true
      attributes:
        hashrate: "40"
        can_receive_distributions: false

    # Regular user that can receive distributions
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      user_script: "agents.regular_user"
      attributes:
        transaction_interval: "60"
        min_transaction_amount: "0.5"
        max_transaction_amount: "2.0"
        can_receive_distributions: "true"

    # Regular user that cannot receive distributions
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      user_script: "agents.regular_user"
      attributes:
        transaction_interval: "90"
        min_transaction_amount: "0.1"
        max_transaction_amount: "1.0"
        can_receive_distributions: "false"
```

### Medium Scale Example

```yaml
# config_agents_medium.yaml
agents:
  user_agents:
    # Mix of miners with different distribution settings
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      is_miner: true
      attributes:
        hashrate: "25"
        can_receive_distributions: true

    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      is_miner: true
      attributes:
        hashrate: "25"
        can_receive_distributions: "1"

    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      is_miner: true
      attributes:
        hashrate: "20"
        can_receive_distributions: false

    # Regular users with varied settings
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      user_script: "agents.regular_user"
      attributes:
        transaction_interval: "60"
        min_transaction_amount: "0.5"
        max_transaction_amount: "2.0"
        can_receive_distributions: true

    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      user_script: "agents.regular_user"
      attributes:
        transaction_interval: "90"
        min_transaction_amount: "0.1"
        max_transaction_amount: "1.0"
        can_receive_distributions: "no"
```

## Agent Discovery Integration

### Filtering Mechanism

The Agent Discovery System filters agents based on the `can_receive_distributions` attribute:

```python
def get_distribution_recipients(self):
    """Get agents that can receive distributions."""
    wallet_agents = self.get_wallet_agents()
    
    # Filter agents that can receive distributions
    recipients = []
    for agent in wallet_agents:
        if self.can_receive_distributions(agent):
            recipients.append(agent)
    
    # Fallback to all wallet agents if none can receive distributions
    if not recipients:
        self.logger.info("No distribution-enabled recipients found, falling back to all wallet agents")
        return wallet_agents
    
    return recipients
```

### Boolean Evaluation

The attribute supports flexible boolean evaluation:

```python
def can_receive_distributions(self, agent):
    """Check if an agent can receive distributions."""
    attributes = agent.get("attributes", {})
    
    # Default to false if not specified
    if "can_receive_distributions" not in attributes:
        return False
    
    value = attributes["can_receive_distributions"]
    
    # Handle various boolean formats
    if isinstance(value, bool):
        return value
    elif isinstance(value, str):
        return value.lower() in ("true", "1", "yes", "on")
    elif isinstance(value, (int, float)):
        return bool(value)
    
    return False
```

## Miner Distributor Integration

### Recipient Selection

The Miner Distributor Agent uses the filtered recipient list:

```python
def select_recipient(self):
    """Select a recipient for mining distribution."""
    recipients = self.agent_discovery.get_distribution_recipients()
    
    if not recipients:
        self.logger.warning("No potential recipients found")
        return None
    
    # Select based on configured strategy
    if self.recipient_selection == "random":
        return random.choice(recipients)
    elif self.recipient_selection == "weighted":
        return self.weighted_selection(recipients)
    
    return recipients[0]
```

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage

The integration includes comprehensive test coverage:

1. **Configuration Parsing**: Tests for all supported boolean formats
2. **Agent Discovery**: Tests for filtering and fallback mechanisms
3. **Miner Distributor**: Tests for recipient selection
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Tests for configurations without the attribute

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the can_receive_distributions test suite
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/test_can_receive_distributions.py
```

### Test Results

All tests pass, confirming:
- Proper parsing of all boolean formats
- Correct filtering of agents based on attribute
- Fallback behavior when no agents can receive distributions
- Backward compatibility with existing configurations

## Backward Compatibility

### Default Behavior

- Existing configurations without the attribute continue to work
- Agents default to `can_receive_distributions: false`
- Fallback mechanism ensures simulations continue to work
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Migration Path

1. **No Action Required**: Existing configurations work unchanged
2. **Gradual Adoption**: Add the attribute to new configurations as needed
3. **Selective Use**: Apply the attribute only where specific control is needed

## Performance Considerations

### Agent Discovery

- The filtering mechanism adds minimal overhead
- Caching ensures efficient repeated lookups
- Fallback mechanism prevents performance degradation

### Configuration Parsing

- Additional attribute parsing has negligible impact
- Validation ensures proper format handling
- Error handling prevents configuration issues

## Use Cases

### 1. Restricted Reward Distribution

```yaml
# Only specific agents receive rewards
agents:
  user_agents:
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      user_script: "agents.regular_user"
      attributes:
        can_receive_distributions: true  # Receives rewards
        
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      user_script: "agents.regular_user"
      attributes:
        can_receive_distributions: false  # Does not receive rewards
```

### 2. Miner-Only Rewards

```yaml
# Only miners receive rewards
agents:
  user_agents:
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      is_miner: true
      attributes:
        hashrate: "50"
        can_receive_distributions: true
        
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      user_script: "agents.regular_user"
      attributes:
        transaction_interval: "60"
        can_receive_distributions: false
```

### 3. Economic Experiments

```yaml
# Study effects of reward concentration
agents:
  user_agents:
    # Small group receives all rewards
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      user_script: "agents.regular_user"
      attributes:
        can_receive_distributions: true
        
    # Large group receives no rewards
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      user_script: "agents.regular_user"
      attributes:
        can_receive_distributions: false
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Attribute Not Recognized**
   - Ensure the attribute is spelled correctly
   - Verify it's in the `attributes` section
   - Check YAML syntax

2. **Unexpected Filtering**
   - Verify the attribute value format
   - Check for conflicting attributes
   - Review agent discovery logs

3. **No Recipients Found**
   - Check if all agents have `can_receive_distributions: false`
   - Verify fallback mechanism is working
   - Review agent registry contents

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check agent registry
cat /tmp/monerosim_shared/agent_registry.json

# Test agent discovery
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/test_can_receive_distributions.py

# Monitor distribution activity
tail -f /tmp/monerosim_shared/transactions.json
```

3. **Performance Metrics**: Track distribution effectiveness
4. **Visualization Tools**: Graphical representation of distribution patterns

### Extension Points

1. **Custom Filters**: Allow user-defined filtering logic
2. **Distribution Strategies**: Additional recipient selection algorithms
3. **Attribute Inheritance**: Parent-child attribute relationships
4. **Time-Based Rules**: Schedule-based distribution control

## Conclusion

The `can_receive_distributions` attribute provides a powerful and flexible mechanism for controlling mining reward distribution in Monerosim simulations. Its integration maintains backward compatibility while enabling sophisticated economic modeling and research scenarios.
