## Overview

The Monerosim Agent Framework is a sophisticated simulation capability that enables realistic cryptocurrency network behavior modeling. The agent framework introduces autonomous participants that make independent decisions, creating emergent network behaviors that closely mirror real-world cryptocurrency ecosystems.

### Why the Agent Framework?

Traditional network simulations often fail to capture the complex interactions between different types of network participants. The agent framework was created to:

- **Model Realistic Behavior**: Simulate how real users, marketplaces, and mining pools interact
- **Enable Emergent Properties**: Allow complex behaviors to emerge from simple agent rules
- **Support Research**: Provide a platform for studying cryptocurrency economics and network dynamics
- **Test at Scale**: Simulate networks from small (2-10 participants) to large (100+ participants)
- **Facilitate Attack Research**: Enable testing of various attack scenarios and defenses

### Key Features

- **Autonomous Agents**: Each agent makes independent decisions based on its role and configuration
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports simulations from 2 to 100+ participants
- **Realistic Transaction Patterns**: Users send transactions based on configurable patterns
- **Coordinated Mining**: Block generation is orchestrated for consistent blockchain progress
- **Shared State Communication**: Agents coordinate through a decentralized state mechanism
- **Production-Ready**: Fully integrated with Shadow network simulator

## Architecture

The agent framework is built on a modular architecture that separates concerns and enables easy extension:

### Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each agent type is self-contained and can be extended independently
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Agents handle failures gracefully and continue operation
3. **Observability**: All agent actions are logged and traceable
4. **Decentralization**: No central control point; agents coordinate through shared state
5. **Realism**: Agent behaviors are modeled after real-world participants

## Agent Types

### Base Agent (base_agent.py)

The abstract base class that provides common functionality for all agents:

**Key Features:**
- Lifecycle management (setup, run, cleanup)
- RPC connection handling for both daemon and wallet
- Shared state read/write operations
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown
- Logging infrastructure
- Common utility methods

**Methods:**
- `setup()`: Initialize RPC connections and agent-specific setup
- `run()`: Main agent loop
- `run_iteration()`: Single iteration of agent behavior (abstract)
- `cleanup()`: Clean up resources before shutdown
- `write_shared_state()`: Write data to shared state files
- `read_shared_state()`: Read data from shared state files
- `wait_for_height()`: Wait for blockchain to reach target height
- `wait_for_wallet_sync()`: Wait for wallet to sync with daemon

### Regular User Agent (regular_user.py)

Represents typical Monero users who maintain wallets and send transactions.

**Characteristics:**
- Maintains a personal wallet
- Sends transactions to marketplaces at configurable intervals
- Monitors transaction confirmations
- Adjusts behavior based on wallet balance

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `transaction_frequency`: Probability of sending transaction per iteration (0.0-1.0)
- `min_amount`: Minimum transaction amount in XMR
- `max_amount`: Maximum transaction amount in XMR

**Behavior Pattern:**
1. Initialize wallet and get address
2. Register address in shared state
3. Periodically check balance
4. Decide whether to send transaction based on frequency parameter
5. Select random marketplace from available list
6. Send transaction with random amount within configured range
7. Track pending transactions until confirmed

### Marketplace Agent (marketplace.py)

Represents services that receive payments from users.

**Characteristics:**
- Operates a receiving wallet
- Tracks all incoming payments
- Maintains transaction history
- Publishes receiving address for users

**Key Functionality:**
- Monitors incoming transfers continuously
- Logs payment details (amount, sender, confirmation status)
- Updates statistics (total received, transaction count)
- Provides payment history for analysis

**Statistics Tracked:**
- Total amount received
- Number of transactions
- Current balance (locked and unlocked)
- Payment timestamps and confirmation status

### Mining Pool Agent (mining_pool.py)

Represents mining pools that participate in block generation.

**Note**: The current implementation faces challenges with mining RPC methods. The original design intended for pools to:
- Start/stop mining based on signals from block controller
- Track blocks found
- Report mining statistics

**Current Status:**
- Mining RPC methods (`start_mining`, `stop_mining`, `mining_status`) return "Method not found"
- This prevents the intended mining coordination
- Alternative approach implemented in Block Controller Agent

### Block Controller Agent (block_controller.py)

Orchestrates block generation across the network using a proven approach.

**Implementation Note**: Due to mining RPC limitations, this agent uses the `generateblocks` RPC method directly on the daemon, which is the same approach used in the working `scripts/block_controller.py`.

**Characteristics:**
- Creates its own wallet to get a mining address
- Generates blocks at regular intervals using daemon's `generateblocks` method
- Tracks blockchain progress
- Ensures consistent block generation for the simulation

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `target_block_interval`: Seconds between block generations
- `blocks_per_generation`: Number of blocks to generate each time

**Behavior Pattern:**
1. Create wallet and get mining address
2. Wait for configured interval
3. Generate blocks using daemon RPC
4. Update statistics
5. Repeat until simulation ends

## Communication Architecture

Agents communicate through a shared state mechanism using JSON files in a common directory:

```
/tmp/monerosim_shared/
├── users.json                    # List of all user agents
├── marketplaces.json            # List of all marketplace agents  
├── mining_pools.json            # List of all mining pools
├── block_controller.json        # Block controller status
├── transactions.json            # Transaction log
├── blocks_found.json           # Block discovery log
├── marketplace_payments.json    # Payment tracking
├── mining_signals/             # Mining control signals
│   ├── poolalpha.json
│   └── poolbeta.json
└── [agent]_stats.json          # Per-agent statistics
```

### Shared State Design

The shared state mechanism enables:

1. **Service Discovery**: Agents can find other agents (e.g., users finding marketplaces)
2. **Coordination**: Block controller can signal mining pools
3. **Monitoring**: External tools can observe simulation progress
4. **Analysis**: Researchers can analyze agent interactions

### File Formats

**users.json** - Array of user registrations:
```json
[
  {
    "agent_id": "user001",
    "address": "4A5X...",
    "type": "regular_user",
    "timestamp": 1234567890.123
  }
]
```

**marketplaces.json** - Array of marketplace registrations:
```json
[
  {
    "agent_id": "marketplace001",
    "address": "4B7Y...",
    "type": "marketplace",
    "timestamp": 1234567890.456
  }
]
```

**transactions.json** - Array of transaction records:

    "timestamp": 1234567891.789
  }
]
```

## Configuration

### Agent Configuration Files

Monerosim provides three pre-configured agent simulation scales:

#### Small Scale (config_agents_small.yaml)
```yaml
general:
  stop_time: "10m"
  fresh_blockchain: true
  log_level: debug
  
agents:
  regular_users:
    count: 2
    transaction_interval: 30
    min_transaction_amount: 0.5
    max_transaction_amount: 2.0
    
  marketplaces:
    count: 1
    
  mining_pools:
    count: 1
    
block_generation:
  interval: 30
  pools_per_round: 1
```

#### Medium Scale (config_agents_medium.yaml)
```yaml
agents:
  regular_users:
    count: 10
    transaction_interval: 60
    
  marketplaces:
    count: 3
    
  mining_pools:
    count: 2
```

#### Large Scale (config_agents_large.yaml)
```yaml

  regular_users:
    count: 100
    transaction_interval: 120
    
  marketplaces:
    count: 10
    
  mining_pools:
    count: 5
```

### Shadow Integration

The `shadow_agents.rs` module generates Shadow configuration that:

1. Creates Monero daemon processes for each user
2. Creates wallet RPC processes for users and marketplaces
3. Launches agent processes with appropriate parameters
4. Sets up network topology with proper IP addressing
5. Configures process start times to ensure proper initialization order

## Running Simulations

### Prerequisites

1. Build Monerosim and Monero binaries:
```bash
./setup.sh
cargo build --release
```

2. Ensure Python environment is set up:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

### Running Agent-Based Simulations

#### Small Scale Test
```bash
# Generate configuration
./target/release/monerosim --config config_agents_small.yaml --output shadow_agents_output --mode agents

# Run simulation
shadow shadow_agents_output/shadow_agents.yaml
```

#### Medium Scale Test
```bash
./target/release/monerosim --config config_agents_medium.yaml --output shadow_agents_output --mode agents
shadow shadow_agents_output/shadow_agents.yaml
```

#### Large Scale Test
```bash
./target/release/monerosim --config config_agents_large.yaml --output shadow_agents_output --mode agents
shadow shadow_agents_output/shadow_agents.yaml
```

### Monitoring Simulations

While the simulation runs, you can monitor agent activity:

```bash
# Watch shared state files
watch -n 1 'ls -la /tmp/monerosim_shared/'

# Monitor transactions
tail -f /tmp/monerosim_shared/transactions.json

# Check agent statistics
cat /tmp/monerosim_shared/user001_stats.json
```

## Shared State Structure

### Directory Layout

All shared state files are stored in `/tmp/monerosim_shared/`:

```
/tmp/monerosim_shared/
├── Registration Files
│   ├── users.json                 # All registered users
│   ├── marketplaces.json         # All registered marketplaces
│   └── mining_pools.json         # All registered mining pools
│
├── Activity Logs
│   ├── transactions.json         # All transactions sent
│   ├── marketplace_payments.json # All payments received
│   └── blocks_found.json        # All blocks discovered
│
├── Control Files
│   ├── block_controller.json    # Block controller configuration
│   └── mining_signals/          # Mining control signals
│       ├── poolalpha.json
│       └── poolbeta.json
│
└── Statistics Files
    ├── user_[id]_stats.json     # Per-user statistics
    ├── marketplace_[id]_stats.json # Per-marketplace statistics
    ├── pool_[id]_stats.json     # Per-pool statistics
    └── block_controller_stats.json # Block generation statistics
```

### File Update Patterns

1. **Registration Files**: Append-only during agent initialization
2. **Activity Logs**: Append-only throughout simulation
3. **Control Files**: Updated by block controller
4. **Statistics Files**: Periodically updated by each agent

## Agent Behaviors

### Regular User Behavior

1. **Initialization Phase**:
   - Create or open wallet
   - Get wallet address
   - Register in shared state
   - Wait for initial sync

2. **Transaction Decision Process**:
   ```python
   if balance >= min_amount and random() < transaction_frequency:
       marketplace = select_random_marketplace()
       amount = random(min_amount, max_amount)
       send_transaction(marketplace, amount)
   ```

3. **Transaction Lifecycle**:
   - Create transaction
   - Submit to network
   - Track in pending list
   - Monitor for confirmations
   - Remove from pending when confirmed

### Marketplace Behavior

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create receiving wallet
   - Publish address to shared state
   - Begin monitoring for payments

2. **Payment Processing**:
   - Check for new incoming transfers every 20 seconds
   - Log each new payment with details
   - Update running statistics
   - Write payment records to shared state

3. **Statistics Tracking**:
   - Total amount received
   - Transaction count
   - Current balances
   - Payment history

### Block Controller Behavior

1. **Setup**:
   - Create wallet for mining address
   - Connect to daemon RPC
   - Register in shared state

2. **Block Generation Loop**:
   ```python
   while running:
       if time_since_last_block >= target_interval:
           generate_blocks(blocks_per_generation)
           update_statistics()
       sleep(1)
   ```

## Scalability

The agent framework is designed to scale from small development tests to large production simulations:

### Performance Characteristics

#### Small Scale (2-10 agents)
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal (< 1GB RAM)
- **Simulation Speed**: Near real-time
- **Use Cases**: Development, testing, debugging
- **Typical Duration**: 10-30 minutes

#### Medium Scale (10-50 agents)
- **Resource Usage**: Moderate (2-4GB RAM)
- **Simulation Speed**: 2-5x slower than real-time
- **Use Cases**: Realistic testing, research
- **Typical Duration**: 1-4 hours

#### Large Scale (50-100+ agents)
- **Resource Usage**: High (8-16GB RAM)
- **Simulation Speed**: 5-10x slower than real-time
- **Use Cases**: Stress testing, large-scale research
- **Typical Duration**: 1-2 hours

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Staggered Startup**: Agents start at different times to prevent resource contention
   ```python
   start_time: format!("{}s", 60 + i * 2)  # 2-second intervals
   ```

2. **Efficient RPC Usage**: Connection pooling and retry logic minimize overhead

3. **Batch State Updates**: Agents can batch multiple state updates

4. **Configurable Logging**: Adjust log levels based on scale:
   - Small: `debug` for detailed analysis
   - Medium: `info` for normal operation
   - Large: `warning` to reduce overhead

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Mining RPC Methods Not Found

**Issue**: The `start_mining`, `stop_mining`, and `mining_status` RPC methods return "Method not found" errors.

**Cause**: The Monero daemon may not have these RPC methods enabled or they may require different parameters.

**Solution**: The Block Controller Agent uses the `generateblocks` RPC method instead, which is proven to work:
```python
result = self.daemon_rpc._make_request("generateblocks", {
    "amount_of_blocks": self.blocks_per_generation,
    "wallet_address": self.wallet_address
})
```

#### 2. Agents Can't Connect to RPC

**Issue**: Agents fail to connect to daemon or wallet RPC services.

**Cause**: Incorrect IP addresses or ports in configuration.

**Solution**: Ensure the Shadow configuration properly assigns IPs:
```python
# Each agent must use its assigned IP
--rpc-host {} # Use the host's IP, not localhost
```

#### 3. No Transactions Being Sent

**Issue**: Users don't send any transactions.

**Cause**: No balance available (requires mining to generate funds).

**Solution**: 
- Ensure block generation is working
- Wait for blocks to mature (typically 60 blocks)
- Check user wallet balances in logs

#### 4. Shared State Access Errors

**Issue**: Agents can't read/write shared state files.

**Cause**: Permission issues or missing directory.

**Solution**: The framework automatically creates `/tmp/monerosim_shared/` with proper permissions.

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Debug Logging**:
   ```yaml
   log_level: debug
   ```

2. **Monitor Agent Logs**:
   ```bash
   grep "user001" shadow.data/hosts/user001/stdout-user001.log
   ```

3. **Check RPC Connectivity**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://11.0.0.10:28090/json_rpc \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"get_info"}'
   ```

4. **Verify Shared State**:
   ```bash
   cat /tmp/monerosim_shared/users.json | jq .
   ```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Transaction Flow

```python
# User agent decides to send transaction
def _send_transaction(self):
    # Get available marketplaces
    marketplaces = self._get_marketplace_addresses()
    marketplace = random.choice(marketplaces)
    
    # Generate random amount
    amount = random.uniform(self.min_amount, self.max_amount)
    
    # Send transaction
    result = self.wallet_rpc.transfer([{
        "address": marketplace["address"],
        "amount": int(amount * 1e12)
    }])
    
    # Log to shared state
    self.append_shared_list("transactions.json", {
        "sender": self.agent_id,
        "recipient": marketplace["agent_id"],
        "amount": amount,
        "tx_hash": result["tx_hash"],
        "timestamp": time.time()
    })
```

### Example 2: Custom Agent Configuration

```yaml
# config_custom.yaml
agents:
  regular_users:
    count: 20
    transaction_interval: 45
    min_transaction_amount: 0.01
    max_transaction_amount: 0.5
    
  marketplaces:
    count: 5
    
block_generation:
  interval: 60  # 1 minute blocks
  blocks_per_generation: 2
```

### Example 3: Analyzing Simulation Results

```python
import json
import pandas as pd

# Load transaction data
with open('/tmp/monerosim_shared/transactions.json', 'r') as f:
    transactions = json.load(f)

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(transactions)

# Analyze transaction patterns
print(f"Total transactions: {len(df)}")
print(f"Average amount: {df['amount'].mean():.4f} XMR")
print(f"Transactions per user: {df.groupby('sender').size().mean():.2f}")
```
