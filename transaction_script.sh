# Two-Wallet Transaction Testing Script
# This script uses two separate wallet RPC instances:
# - wallet1 (mining wallet) on port 28091
# - wallet2 (recipient wallet) on port 28092
# 
# New strategy: Wait 1 hour for mining rewards to unlock, then create transaction
# Block production: 1 block per minute (realistic timing)
# Mining rewards unlock after 10 confirmations = 10 minutes
# Wait 1 hour to be absolutely sure, then test transaction
