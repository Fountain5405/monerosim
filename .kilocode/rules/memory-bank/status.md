# Monerosim Project Status

## Project Status Summary

The minimum viable simulation for Monerosim is **working**. The project has successfully demonstrated all core functionality required for a baseline simulation, including P2P connectivity, block generation, synchronization, and transaction processing.

With the primary goal achieved, the project is moving from initial implementation to a phase of stabilization, documentation, and feature expansion.

### Current State

- **P2P Connectivity**: SUCCESS
- **Block Generation**: SUCCESS
- **Block Synchronization**: SUCCESS
- **Transaction Processing**: SUCCESS

All major technical hurdles for a basic simulation have been overcome. The focus is now on improving the robustness and usability of the simulation framework.

## Simulation Status

### Minimum Simulation Requirements

The minimum simulation requirements were:
1. Two Monero nodes running in the simulation
2. One node functioning as a mining node
3. The second node synchronizing from the mining node
4. Transaction sending from the mining node to the second node

### Current Status of Requirements

1.  **Two Monero Nodes**:
    -   **Status**: SUCCESS
    -   **Details**: Two nodes (`A0` and `A1`) are running stable and connected in the simulation.

2.  **Mining Node Functionality**:
    -   **Status**: SUCCESS
    -   **Details**: Node `A0` is successfully generating blocks and receiving mining rewards.

3.  **Node Synchronization**:
    -   **Status**: SUCCESS
    -   **Details**: Node `A1` correctly synchronizes the blockchain from node `A0`.

4.  **Transaction Functionality**:
    -   **Status**: SUCCESS
    -   **Details**: A transaction was successfully created, sent from the mining wallet (`wallet1`) to the recipient wallet (`wallet2`), and confirmed on the network.

## Next Development Priorities

With the successful completion of the minimum viable simulation, the development priorities have been updated to focus on the next phase of the project.

### Immediate Focus

1.  **Stabilization and Refinement**:
    -   Improve test automation to provide clear pass/fail diagnostics.
    -   Refactor and clean up code to enhance maintainability.
    -   Establish a performance baseline for future optimizations.

2.  **Documentation**:
    -   Create comprehensive documentation for the working configuration.
    -   Document the steps required to reproduce the successful simulation.

### Medium-term Improvements

1.  **Enhanced Testing Framework**:
    -   Develop more granular tests for individual components.
    -   Implement automated verification of simulation results.

2.  **Network Topology Expansion**:
    -   Add support for more complex network topologies (e.g., more than two nodes).
    -   Introduce realistic network conditions like latency and packet loss.

3.  **Monitoring and Analysis**:
    -   Enhance monitoring scripts to provide more detailed insights into network health.
    -   Develop better tools for visualizing simulation results.

### Long-term Goals

1.  **UI for Configuration/Visualization**:
    -   Develop a user-friendly interface for creating and managing simulations.

2.  **Protocol Modification Testing**:
    -   Build the capability to test modifications to the Monero protocol.

3.  **CI/CD Integration**:
    -   Integrate simulation tests into a continuous integration pipeline.
