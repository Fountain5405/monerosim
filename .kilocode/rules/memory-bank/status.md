# Monerosim Project Status

## Project Status Summary

Monerosim is a Rust-based tool designed to generate configuration files for the Shadow network simulator to run Monero cryptocurrency network simulations. The project is in active development with a focus on achieving a minimum viable simulation.

### Current State

The project has established a solid foundation with the following components:
- Configuration file parsing and validation
- Shadow YAML configuration generation
- Script-based testing infrastructure
- Monero daemon integration with Shadow compatibility
- Wallet integration for transaction testing

### Progress Made

1. **Core Infrastructure**:
   - Rust-based configuration parser and generator
   - Shadow configuration generation
   - Build system for Shadow-compatible Monero binaries
   - Network topology definition

2. **Testing Framework**:
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Retry mechanisms for critical operations
   - Monitoring and diagnostic tools
   - Transaction verification

3. **Documentation**:
   - Architecture documentation
   - Configuration guidelines
   - Development setup instructions

### Critical Issues

Several critical issues are currently preventing the minimum simulation from working correctly:

1. **P2P Connectivity Issues**:
   - Node A0 (mining node) fails to establish P2P connections with peers
   - No P2P connectivity is established between nodes

2. **Block Generation Issues**:
   - Block-controller script fails with "Failed to get wallet address" error
   - No evidence of successful block generation on node A0
   - Node A0 initializes with blockchain height 693 but doesn't mine new blocks

3. **Wallet Integration Issues**:
   - Wallet1 (mining wallet) encounters errors: "file not found "/tmp/wallet1_data/mining_wallet.keys""
   - Transaction-test script fails with "Failed to get Wallet1 balance after multiple attempts"

## Simulation Status

### Minimum Simulation Requirements

The minimum simulation requirements are:
1. Two Monero nodes running in the simulation
2. One node functioning as a mining node
3. The second node synchronizing from the mining node
4. Transaction sending from the mining node to the second node

### Current Status of Requirements

1. **Two Monero Nodes**:
   - **Status**: PARTIAL
   - **Details**: Node A0 starts successfully, but Node A1 fails to establish P2P connections

2. **Mining Node Functionality**:
   - **Status**: FAILED
   - **Details**: Node A0 is configured for mining but fails to generate blocks. The block_controller.sh script fails with "Failed to get wallet address" error.

3. **Node Synchronization**:
   - **Status**: FAILED
   - **Details**: Since Node A1 fails to start and there's no P2P connectivity, block synchronization cannot occur.

4. **Transaction Functionality**:
   - **Status**: FAILED
   - **Details**: Transaction-test script fails with "Failed to get Wallet1 balance after multiple attempts" because no mining rewards are generated.

### Root Causes of Failures

1. **P2P Configuration Issues**:
   - P2P connectivity settings need to be optimized for the Shadow simulation environment
   - This prevents proper communication between nodes

2. **Wallet Directory Issues**:
   - Wallet directories (/tmp/wallet1_data and /tmp/wallet2_data) may not be properly created or accessible
   - This prevents wallet creation and operation

3. **P2P Connectivity Configuration**:
   - Despite configuration for exclusive and priority nodes, P2P connections are not established
   - Node A0 reports "No available peer in white list filtered by 1" errors

4. **Block Generation Failure**:
   - The block_controller.sh script fails to retrieve the wallet address
   - This prevents the mining process from starting

### Verification Steps Attempted

1. **Daemon Readiness Verification**:
   - Both nodes are verified to be responsive to RPC calls
   - Node A0 initializes with blockchain height 693

2. **P2P Connectivity Verification**:
   - Monitor script shows no active P2P connections between nodes
   - get_connections RPC calls return empty results

3. **Block Generation Verification**:
   - Block controller script attempts to generate blocks but fails
   - No height increase is observed on Node A0

4. **Transaction Testing**:
   - Transaction test script attempts to create and verify transactions but fails
   - No mining rewards are available for transactions

## Next Development Priorities

### Immediate Fixes

1. **Fix Node A1 Configuration**:
   - Verify all command-line options are compatible with the Monero version being used
   - Test with a minimal set of options first, then add more as needed

2. **Address Wallet File Issues**:
   - Ensure wallet directories are properly created and accessible
   - Add explicit permissions checks and error handling for wallet directories
   - Implement more robust wallet creation and verification

3. **Debug P2P Connectivity**:
   - Review network configuration in shadow.yaml
   - Simplify P2P connection settings to ensure basic connectivity works
   - Add more diagnostic logging for P2P connection attempts
   - Verify IP addresses and ports are correctly configured

4. **Fix Block Generation**:
   - Debug wallet address retrieval in block_controller.sh
   - Implement alternative block generation methods if needed
   - Add more robust error handling and retries for critical operations

## Lessons Learned

### Implementation Insights

1. **Shadow Integration Complexity**:
   - Integrating Monero with Shadow requires careful attention to networking code
   - Time-related operations in Monero need special handling in simulation
   - Shadow's process management requires specific environment variables and settings

2. **P2P Connectivity Challenges**:
   - Monero's P2P network is designed with privacy in mind, making direct connections challenging
   - Exclusive and priority node settings don't guarantee connections
   - Proper initialization sequence is critical for P2P connectivity

3. **Wallet Integration**:
   - Wallet RPC services require careful setup and initialization
   - File permissions and directory access are common points of failure
   - Wallet state persistence between runs needs special attention

4. **Configuration Generation**:
   - Shadow configuration requires precise formatting and structure
   - Process startup timing is critical for proper initialization
   - Environment variables significantly impact process behavior in Shadow

### Development Challenges

1. **Debugging in Simulation**:
   - Debugging in a simulated environment is more complex than real systems
   - Log analysis is the primary debugging tool
   - Reproducing issues requires careful control of simulation parameters

2. **Build System Complexity**:
   - Building Shadow-compatible Monero requires specific patches and flags
   - Dependency management is challenging across different environments
   - Build time can be significant for full Monero builds

3. **Testing Methodology**:
   - Testing needs to be incremental, starting with minimal functionality
   - Each component should be tested in isolation before integration
   - Automated testing is essential for reliable development

4. **Documentation Importance**:
   - Comprehensive documentation is critical for complex systems
   - Architecture documentation helps maintain system understanding
   - Procedural documentation ensures reproducible builds and tests

### Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Incremental Approach**:

   - Add complexity incrementally, testing at each step
   - Document working configurations for reference

2. **Improved Diagnostics**:
   - Add more detailed logging throughout the system
   - Develop specialized diagnostic tools for common issues

3. **Simplified Configuration**:
   - Create template-based configurations for common scenarios
   - Provide sensible defaults that work in most cases
   - Add validation to prevent common configuration errors

4. **Collaborative Development**:
   - Engage with both Monero and Shadow communities
   - Share findings and improvements with both projects
   - Leverage existing knowledge and tools from similar projects
