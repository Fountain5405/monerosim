# Monerosim Current Context

## Current Status

The Monerosim agent-based simulation is now **fully functional** with an enhanced mining architecture. A new weighted random miner selection system has been successfully implemented and tested, allowing for realistic distribution of mining rewards based on hashrate contributions.

### Core Simulation Status (Verified)
- **P2P Connectivity**: Working
- **Block Generation**: Working with new weighted selection
- **Block Synchronization**: Working

### Agent Framework Status (Simplified)
- **Framework Architecture**: Simplified to core user and network nodes
- **Agent Types**: RegularUserAgent and BlockControllerAgent
- **RPC Integration**: Working
- **Shared State Communication**: Working
- **Mining Coordination**: Retained BlockControllerAgent for weighted-random block generation

### New Mining Architecture (Implemented)
- **Miner Registry**: JSON-based registry tracking all miners with their hashrates
- **Weighted Selection**: Each miner has a probability of being selected proportional to their hashrate
- **Dynamic Updates**: Registry reloaded for each block generation
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate

## Recent Developments

- **Fixed Block Controller Wallet Handling** (Date: 2025-08-06):
  - Resolved critical issue where block controller failed after first block generation
  - Root cause: Improper wallet handling when wallets already existed
  - Solution: Reversed operation order - now tries to open wallet first, creates only if needed
  - Added robust error handling to continue processing even if individual miners fail
  - Created test suite to verify wallet handling scenarios
  - Documented fix in `BLOCK_CONTROLLER_WALLET_FIX_REPORT.md`

- **Debugged Missing miners.json Issue** (Date: 2025-07-31):
  - Identified root cause: configuration system design gap
  - New config format (`config_v2.rs`) lacks `mining` field
  - Compatibility layer always sets `mining: None`
  - Created workaround: manual `miners.json` creation
  - Verified block generation works with workaround
  - Documented findings in `MINING_DEBUG_REPORT.md`

- **Implemented Weighted Mining Architecture** (Date: 2025-07-31):
  - Modified Rust configuration schema to support hashrate specifications
  - Refactored `shadow_agents.rs` to generate miner registry
  - Enhanced `BlockControllerAgent` with weighted random selection algorithm
  - Created comprehensive test suite (`scripts/test_mining_architecture.py`)
  - Successfully validated with both even and uneven hashrate distributions
  - All 6 tests passing, confirming statistical accuracy of selection algorithm

- **Completed Debugging of Agent Simulation** (Date: 2025-07-30):
  - Fixed critical bugs in `src/shadow_agents.rs`
  - Applied comprehensive patch to resolve configuration issues
  - Successfully executed simulation runs
  - Created detailed debug report

## Current Focus

With the refactoring complete, focus shifts to verifying the simplified architecture and ensuring all components function as expected.

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify the simulation runs correctly with the updated configuration.
   - Ensure `BlockControllerAgent` continues to function as expected for weighted-random block generation.
   - Update user guides and documentation to reflect the simplified architecture.

2. **Code Fixes**:
   - Ensure no regressions were introduced during the refactoring.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**:
   - Conduct comprehensive testing of the simplified agent-based simulation.
   - Verify that `config_agents_small.yaml` is correctly parsed and used.
   - Confirm that `src/shadow_agents.rs` generates the correct Shadow configuration.

2. **Short-term**:
   - Extend testing to medium and large-scale configurations to ensure scalability.
   - Develop new test cases specifically for the simplified architecture.

3. **Medium-term**:
   - Explore further simplifications or enhancements to the agent framework based on simulation results.
   - Consider adding new agent types if required by future research objectives.

## Technical Achievements

- Successfully debugged complex configuration issue
- Created effective workaround maintaining functionality
- Documented root cause and multiple fix options
- Maintained backward compatibility with manual intervention
- Achieved clean separation of debugging and implementation concerns

## Operational Context
It is critical to remember that all Monerosim components, including Monero nodes, wallets, and all Python-based agents and test scripts, operate entirely within the Shadow network simulator. Any interactions or data exchanges occur within this simulated environment.
