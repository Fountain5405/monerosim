# Monerosim Current Context

## Current Status

The minimum viable simulation for Monerosim remains **working**. A major Python migration of all test scripts has been **completed but awaits verification** to ensure the new infrastructure maintains the same reliability as the original implementation.

### Core Simulation Status (Last Verified)
- **P2P Connectivity**: Working
- **Block Generation**: Working
- **Block Synchronization**: Working
- **Transaction Processing**: Working

### Python Migration Status (Awaiting Verification)
- **Migration Complete**: All test scripts have been migrated to Python
- **Test Coverage**: 95%+ coverage with 50+ unit tests created
- **Feature Parity**: Designed to maintain 100% feature parity with bash scripts
- **Verification Pending**: Full integration testing needed to confirm reliability

## Recent Developments

- **Completed Python Migration** (Pending Verification):
  - Migrated all 6 core testing scripts from Bash to Python
  - Created supporting modules (`error_handling.py`, `network_config.py`)
  - Established Python virtual environment at `/home/lever65/monerosim_dev/monerosim/venv`
  - Created comprehensive test suite with unit tests for all scripts
  - Generated extensive documentation for the migration

- **Migration Details**:
  - `simple_test.sh` → `simple_test.py`
  - `sync_check.sh` → `sync_check.py`
  - `block_controller.sh` → `block_controller.py`
  - `monitor_script.sh` → `monitor.py`
  - `test_p2p_connectivity.sh` → `test_p2p_connectivity.py`
  - New: `transaction_script.py` (enhanced transaction handling)

## Current Focus

With the Python migration technically complete, the current focus is:

1. **Verification Phase**: Thoroughly testing the new Python scripts in actual Shadow simulations to ensure they maintain the reliability of the bash versions
2. **Issue Resolution**: Addressing any discrepancies or issues found during verification
3. **Documentation Review**: Ensuring all documentation accurately reflects the current state
4. **Transition Planning**: Preparing for the switch from bash to Python scripts once verified

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Verification Phase)**:
   - Run comprehensive integration tests with Python scripts
   - Compare Python script behavior against bash script baseline
   - Document any behavioral differences or issues
   - Fix any critical issues discovered during verification

2. **Short-term (Post-Verification)**:
   - Update all references to use Python scripts
   - Add deprecation notices to bash scripts
   - Establish performance baselines with new infrastructure
   - Set up CI/CD with Python test suite

3. **Medium-term**:
   - Expand network topology support
   - Enhance monitoring capabilities
   - Add configuration file support
   - Develop programmatic APIs

## Important Notes

- Bash scripts remain available as fallback until Python scripts are fully verified
- The core simulation functionality (written in Rust) remains unchanged and working
- Python migration represents infrastructure improvement, not core functionality change
