# Monerosim Current Context

## Current Status

The Monerosim agent-based simulation is now **fully functional** with an enhanced mining architecture. A new weighted random miner selection system has been successfully implemented and tested, allowing for realistic distribution of mining rewards based on hashrate contributions.

### Core Simulation Status (Verified)
- **P2P Connectivity**: Working
- **Block Generation**: Working with new weighted selection
- **Block Synchronization**: Working
- **Transaction Processing**: Ready for testing

### Agent Framework Status (Enhanced)
- **Framework Architecture**: Complete with mining registry
- **Agent Types**: All 5 agent types operational
- **RPC Integration**: Working
- **Shared State Communication**: Working
- **Mining Coordination**: Enhanced with weighted random selection based on hashrate

### New Mining Architecture (Implemented)
- **Miner Registry**: JSON-based registry tracking all miners with their hashrates
- **Weighted Selection**: Each miner has a probability of being selected proportional to their hashrate
- **Dynamic Updates**: Registry reloaded for each block generation
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate

## Recent Developments

- **Debugged Missing miners.json Issue** (Date: 2025-07-31):
  - Identified root cause: configuration system design gap
  - New config format (`config_v2.rs`) lacks `mining` field
  - Compatibility layer always sets `mining: None`
  - Created workaround: manual `miners.json` creation
  - Verified block generation works with workaround
  - Documented findings in `MINING_DEBUG_REPORT.md`

- **Implemented Weighted Mining Architecture** (Date: 2025-07-31):
  - Modified Rust configuration schema to support hashrate specifications
  - Refactored `shadow_agents.rs` to generate miner registry
  - Enhanced `BlockControllerAgent` with weighted random selection algorithm
  - Created comprehensive test suite (`scripts/test_mining_architecture.py`)
  - Successfully validated with both even and uneven hashrate distributions
  - All 6 tests passing, confirming statistical accuracy of selection algorithm

- **Completed Debugging of Agent Simulation** (Date: 2025-07-30):
  - Fixed critical bugs in `src/shadow_agents.rs`
  - Applied comprehensive patch to resolve configuration issues
  - Successfully executed simulation runs
  - Created detailed debug report

## Current Focus

With the mining issue debugged and workaround implemented, focus shifts to permanent fixes and production deployment.

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Use manual `miners.json` workaround for current simulations
   - Document workaround in user guides
   - Monitor block generation in production

2. **Code Fixes**:
   - Update `config_v2.rs` to include mining configuration
   - Fix `config_compat.rs` to properly convert mining settings
   - Add integration tests for configuration parsing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**:
   - Apply workaround to all agent simulations
   - Update documentation with miners.json requirements
   - Test with medium and large scale configurations

2. **Short-term**:
   - Implement permanent fix in configuration system
   - Add automated tests for miners.json generation
   - Create migration guide for existing configs

3. **Medium-term**:
   - Consider dynamic miner registration approach
   - Implement more sophisticated mining strategies
   - Add support for mining pool hierarchies

## Technical Achievements

- Successfully debugged complex configuration issue
- Created effective workaround maintaining functionality
- Documented root cause and multiple fix options
- Maintained backward compatibility with manual intervention
- Achieved clean separation of debugging and implementation concerns

## Known Issues

- **Configuration System Gap**: Mining section in YAML files is ignored
  - **Workaround**: Manually create `/tmp/monerosim_shared/miners.json`
  - **Permanent Fix**: Pending code changes to config system
