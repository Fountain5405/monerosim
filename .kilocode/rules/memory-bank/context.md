# Monerosim Current Context

## Current Status

Monerosim is in active development with a focus on achieving a minimum viable simulation. The project has made significant progress with the following components:

- Basic configuration file generation for Shadow
- Integration with Shadow network simulator
- Modified Monero daemon compatibility
- Script-based testing infrastructure

## Recent Developments

- Initial implementation of P2P connectivity between Monero nodes
- Basic block generation and synchronization functionality implementation
- Wallet integration for transaction testing is in place
- Error handling and monitoring scripts have been developed
- Modified configuration to use full blocks instead of pruned blocks by removing MONERO_SYNC_PRUNED_BLOCKS environment variable

## Current Focus

The current primary focus is to achieve a minimum working simulation with the following requirements:
1. Two Monero nodes running in the simulation
2. One node functioning as a mining node
3. The second node synchronizing from the mining node
4. Transaction sending from the mining node to the second node

## Known Issues

### P2P Connectivity Issues
- Node A0 (mining node) fails to connect to peers with "No available peer in white list filtered by 1" errors
- No P2P connectivity is established between nodes

### Block Generation Issues
- Block-controller script fails with "Failed to get wallet address" error
- No evidence of successful block generation on node A0
- Node A0 initializes with blockchain height 693 but doesn't mine new blocks

### Block Synchronization Issues
- Since node A1 fails to start and there's no P2P connectivity, block synchronization cannot occur
- No evidence of blockchain synchronization in the logs

### Transaction Processing Issues
- Transaction-test script fails with "Failed to get Wallet1 balance after multiple attempts"
- Wallet1 (mining wallet) encounters errors: "file not found "/tmp/wallet1_data/mining_wallet.keys""
- No transactions are processed between wallets

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term (Current Sprint)**:
   - Fix Node A1 Configuration:
     - Verify all command-line options are compatible with the Monero version being used
   - Address Wallet File Issues:
     - Ensure wallet directories are properly created and accessible
     - Check permissions on /tmp/wallet1_data and /tmp/wallet2_data directories
   - Debug P2P Connectivity:
     - Review network configuration in shadow.yaml
     - Ensure IP addresses and ports are correctly configured
     - Verify that exclusive node and priority node settings are working correctly
   - Improve Error Handling:
     - Add more robust error handling in the scripts to provide clearer diagnostics
     - Implement retries with exponential backoff for critical operations
   - Run Shadow simulation with a 10-minute timeout to ensure completion
   - Document the working configuration for reproducibility

2. **Medium-term**:
   - Expand simulation to support more complex network topologies
   - Improve performance and reliability of node synchronization
   - Add support for different Monero node configurations
   - Enhance monitoring and analysis capabilities

3. **Long-term**:
   - Develop a web UI for configuration and visualization
   - Support for testing protocol modifications
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing
   - Advanced network condition simulation (latency, packet loss, etc.)
