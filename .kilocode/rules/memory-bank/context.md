# Monerosim Current Context

## Current Status

The minimum viable simulation for Monerosim is now **working**. The project has successfully demonstrated core functionality, including:

- **P2P Connectivity**: Nodes can successfully connect to each other.
- **Block Generation**: The mining node (`A0`) generates new blocks as expected.
- **Block Synchronization**: The second node (`A1`) successfully synchronizes the blockchain from the mining node.
- **Transaction Processing**: A transaction was successfully created on the mining node, sent to the second node, and confirmed on the network.

With the primary goal achieved, the project is moving from initial implementation to a phase of stabilization and feature expansion.

## Recent Developments

- **Achieved Minimum Viable Simulation**: Successfully ran a complete simulation with two nodes, including mining, synchronization, and a confirmed transaction.
- **Resolved Critical Issues**: Fixed all major P2P connectivity, block generation, and wallet integration issues that were previously blocking progress.
- **Validated Core Architecture**: The current architecture and configuration have been proven effective for a basic Monero network simulation in Shadow.
- **Test Script Migration to Python**: Successfully migrated multiple bash scripts to Python:
  - `simple_test.sh` → `simple_test.py` - Basic functionality testing
  - `sync_check.sh` → `sync_check.py` - Network synchronization verification
  - `block_controller.sh` → `block_controller.py` - Block generation control
  - `monitor_script.sh` → `monitor.py` - Simulation monitoring
  - Created `transaction_script.py` - Enhanced transaction handling with better error recovery

## Current Focus

With the minimal simulation working and test infrastructure improving, the current focus has shifted to:

1.  **Test Infrastructure Modernization**: Migrating bash scripts to Python for better reliability and maintainability. Most critical scripts have been successfully migrated. REMEMBER WE HAVE A PYTHON VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT HERE: /home/lever65/monerosim_dev/monerosim/venv
2.  **Stabilization and Refinement**: Ensuring the simulation is reliable, reproducible, and provides consistent results. This includes improving test scripts and error handling.
3.  **Documentation**: Thoroughly documenting the working configuration and the steps required to run the simulation.
4.  **Planning Medium-Term Goals**: Defining the next set of features, such as expanding the network topology and enhancing monitoring capabilities.

## Next Steps

1.  **Short-term (Current Sprint)**:
    - **Complete Test Migration**: Finish migrating any remaining bash scripts to Python
    - **Code Cleanup and Refactoring**: Refactor scripts and Rust code to improve readability and maintainability now that a working baseline is established.
    - **Document Working Configuration**: Create detailed documentation explaining the parameters and setup for the successful simulation.
    - **Performance Baseline**: Measure and document the performance of the current simulation to serve as a baseline for future optimizations.

2.  **Medium-term**:
    - **Expand Network Topologies**: Add support for more complex network configurations (e.g., more than two nodes, different connection patterns).
    - **Enhance Monitoring and Analysis**: Improve monitoring capabilities to provide more detailed insights into network health, transaction flow, and node status.
    - **Configuration Flexibility**: Abstract and generalize the configuration to make it easier to define different simulation scenarios.

3.  **Long-term**:
    - **UI for Configuration/Visualization**: Develop a user interface to simplify the creation of simulation configurations and visualize the results.
    - **Protocol Modification Testing**: Build the capability to test modifications to the Monero protocol within the simulation environment.
    - **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate the simulation tests into a continuous integration pipeline for automated testing.
