# Monerosim Current Context

## Current Status

The Monerosim agent-based simulation is still in development and has things that are broken that need fixing. 

## Recent Developments

- **Fixed Block Controller Wallet Handling** (Date: 2025-08-06):
  - Resolved critical issue where block controller failed after first block generation
  - Root cause: Improper wallet handling when wallets already existed
  - Solution: Reversed operation order - now tries to open wallet first, creates only if needed
  - Added robust error handling to continue processing even if individual miners fail
  - Created test suite to verify wallet handling scenarios
  - Documented fix in `BLOCK_CONTROLLER_WALLET_FIX_REPORT.md`

- **Debugged Missing miners.json Issue** (Date: 2025-07-31):
  - Identified root cause: configuration system design gap
  - New config format (`config_v2.rs`) lacks `mining` field
  - Compatibility layer always sets `mining: None`
  - Created workaround: manual `miners.json` creation
  - Verified block generation works with workaround
  - Documented findings in `MINING_DEBUG_REPORT.md`

- **Implemented Weighted Mining Architecture** (Date: 2025-07-31):
  - Modified Rust configuration schema to support hashrate specifications
  - Refactored `shadow_agents.rs` to generate miner registry
  - Enhanced `BlockControllerAgent` with weighted random selection algorithm
  - Created comprehensive test suite (`scripts/test_mining_architecture.py`)
  - Successfully validated with both even and uneven hashrate distributions
  - All 6 tests passing, confirming statistical accuracy of selection algorithm

- **Completed Debugging of Agent Simulation** (Date: 2025-07-30):
  - Fixed critical bugs in `src/shadow_agents.rs`
  - Applied comprehensive patch to resolve configuration issues
  - Successfully executed simulation runs
  - Created detailed debug report

## Current Focus

The current focus is making sure that the dynamic peer discovery works, and that the complex network topologies using gml files work. 

## Operational Context
It is critical to remember that all Monerosim components, including Monero nodes, wallets, and all Python-based agents and test scripts, operate entirely within the Shadow network simulator. Any interactions or data exchanges occur within this simulated environment.

## Analysis Context
It is critical to remember that the logs for each run for each agent are stored in /home/lever65/monerosim_dev/monerosim/shadow.data/hosts .
