# Monerosim Product Overview

## What It Is
Rust-based configuration generator for Shadow network simulator to run realistic Monero cryptocurrency network simulations with autonomous agent behaviors.

## Core Value Proposition
Enables controlled, reproducible Monero network research and testing without deploying real infrastructure.

## Key Capabilities
- **Scalable Simulations**: 2-40 Monero nodes on single machine
- **Agent Framework**: Autonomous miners, users, and network participants
- **Network Topologies**: Switch-based (simple) or GML-based (realistic internet-like)
- **Geographic Distribution**: Automatic IP allocation across 6 continents
- **Peer Discovery**: Dynamic, Hardcoded, or Hybrid connection modes
- **Reproducible**: Deterministic simulations for scientific research

## Primary Use Cases
1. Protocol modification testing in safe environment
2. Network attack/defense simulation and research
3. Performance analysis under various conditions
4. P2P networking behavior studies
5. Academic cryptocurrency research

## Target Users
- Monero protocol researchers
- Cryptocurrency network developers
- Security researchers
- Academic distributed systems researchers

## Maturity Status
**Production-ready** - 40+ agent simulations validated. Basic 2-node requirements achieved. Focus: large-scale stability and advanced features.
