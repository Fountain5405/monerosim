Generated: 2025-09-13 11:28:43

Simulation Overview:
  Number of nodes analyzed: 54
  Total blocks mined: 1
  Total unique transactions created: 0
  Total transactions included in blocks: 0

Success Criteria Results:

  • Blocks Created: PASS
    1 blocks mined

  • Blocks Propagated: FAIL
    Not all user nodes received blocks

  • Transactions Created Broadcast: FAIL
    Transactions not properly created or propagated

  • Transactions In Blocks: PASS
    No transactions created

Overall Result:
  FAILURE

Recommendations:
  • Check network connectivity between nodes
  • Verify mining configuration
  • Ensure transaction broadcasting is working
  • Check block propagation timing
