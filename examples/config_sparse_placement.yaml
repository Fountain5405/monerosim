# Sparse Agent Placement Configuration
# This configuration demonstrates 100 agents on a 1000-node topology
# Shows how to use sparse placement for efficient large-network simulation
# Use with: python scripts/create_large_scale_gml.py --output topology_1k.gml --nodes 1000

general:
  stop_time: "1h"          # Shorter simulation for testing
  fresh_blockchain: true
  log_level: "debug"       # Detailed logging for sparse placement

network:
  path: "topology_1k.gml"  # Smaller topology for faster testing
  peer_mode: "Dynamic"     # Dynamic discovery works well with sparse placement
  topology: "Star"         # Star topology for clear hub-and-spoke structure

agents:
  user_agents:
    # 10 miners - will be placed sparsely across the 1000 nodes
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      attributes:
        is_miner: true
        hashrate: "10"                   # Higher individual hashrate
        can_receive_distributions: true
      count: 10                          # Only 10 miners

    # 90 regular users - sparse placement across remaining nodes
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      user_script: "agents.regular_user"
      attributes:
        transaction_interval: "60"       # More frequent transactions
        min_transaction_amount: "0.01"   # Smaller transactions
        max_transaction_amount: "0.1"    # Smaller transactions
        can_receive_distributions: false
      count: 90                          # 90 user agents

  block_controller:
    script: "agents.block_controller"

# Sparse Placement Benefits:
# - 100 agents on 1000 nodes = 10% density
# - Efficient use of network resources
# - Geographic distribution maintained
# - Reduced memory footprint
# - Faster simulation execution
# - Realistic large-network behavior

# Expected Behavior:
# - Agents placed on different GML nodes
# - IPs assigned from pre-allocated geographic ranges
# - Dynamic peer discovery finds nearby agents
# - Transactions flow through the network topology
# - Mining distributed across geographic regions
