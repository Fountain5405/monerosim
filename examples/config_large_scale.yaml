# Large-Scale Network Simulation Configuration
# This configuration demonstrates 1000 agents on a 5000-node GML topology
# Use with: python scripts/create_large_scale_gml.py --output topology_5k.gml --nodes 5000

general:
  stop_time: "2h"          # Extended simulation time for large network
  fresh_blockchain: true   # Start with clean blockchain
  log_level: "info"        # Logging level

network:
  path: "topology_5k.gml"  # Path to generated GML topology file
  peer_mode: "Dynamic"     # Use dynamic peer discovery
  topology: "Mesh"         # Network topology type

agents:
  user_agents:
    # 100 miners distributed across the topology
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      attributes:
        is_miner: true
        hashrate: "1"                    # Equal hashrate distribution
        can_receive_distributions: true
      count: 100                         # Create 100 miner instances

    # 900 regular users for transaction activity
    - daemon: "monerod"
      wallet: "monero-wallet-rpc"
      user_script: "agents.regular_user"
      attributes:
        transaction_interval: "300"      # Send transaction every 5 minutes
        min_transaction_amount: "0.1"    # Minimum 0.1 XMR
        max_transaction_amount: "1.0"    # Maximum 1.0 XMR
        can_receive_distributions: false # Don't receive mining rewards
      count: 900                         # Create 900 user instances

  block_controller:
    script: "agents.block_controller"    # Orchestrates mining across miners

# Notes:
# - Total agents: 1000 (100 miners + 900 users)
# - Network nodes: 5000 (from GML topology)
# - Sparse placement: Agents distributed across available GML nodes
# - Geographic distribution: IPs pre-allocated by continent
# - Memory requirements: ~8GB RAM recommended
# - Expected runtime: 2+ hours for full simulation
