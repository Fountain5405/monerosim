Simulation Overview:
  Number of nodes analyzed: 66
  Total blocks mined: 179
  Total unique transactions created: 414
  Total transactions included in blocks: 414

Success Criteria Results:

  • Blocks Created: PASS
    179 blocks mined

  • Blocks Propagated: PASS
    65 user nodes received blocks

  • Transactions Created Broadcast: FAIL
    Transactions not properly created or propagated

  • Transactions In Blocks: PASS
    414/414 transactions included in blocks
