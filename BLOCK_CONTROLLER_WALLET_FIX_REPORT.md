# Block Controller Wallet Handling Fix Report

## Issue Summary

The block controller was failing after the first successful block generation due to improper wallet handling in the `_load_miner_registry()` method. The issue occurred because:

1. On first run: The controller successfully created wallets for all miners and generated a block
2. On subsequent runs: The controller tried to create wallets again, received "Cannot create wallet. Already exists" errors, failed to properly handle these errors, and couldn't load any miners
3. Result: No miners were loaded after the first iteration, preventing further block generation

## Root Cause

The original code attempted to create wallets first, then handled the "already exists" error by trying to open the wallet. However, the error handling logic was flawed and didn't successfully open existing wallets, causing the entire miner loading process to fail.

## Solution Implemented

The fix reverses the order of operations and improves error handling:

1. **Try to open wallet first**: Assumes wallets may already exist from previous runs
2. **Create only if needed**: Only attempts to create a wallet if opening fails with "Wallet not found"
3. **Graceful fallback**: If both opening and creating fail, attempts to get address from current wallet
4. **Continue on error**: Uses `continue` statements to skip problematic miners rather than failing entirely

### Code Changes

Modified `agents/block_controller.py` in the `_load_miner_registry()` method (lines 109-148):

**Before:**
```python
# First try to create the wallet
try:
    wallet_rpc.create_wallet(wallet_name, password="")
    address = wallet_rpc.get_address()
except RPCError as create_err:
    if "Wallet already exists" in str(create_err):
        # Try to open it...
```

**After:**
```python
# First try to open existing wallet
try:
    wallet_rpc.open_wallet(wallet_name, password="")
    address = wallet_rpc.get_address()
except RPCError as open_err:
    if "Wallet not found" in str(open_err):
        # Create new wallet...
```

## Testing

Created `scripts/test_block_controller_wallet_fix.py` to verify the fix handles:

1. **First run scenario**: Successfully creates new wallets
2. **Subsequent run scenario**: Successfully opens existing wallets
3. **Multiple miners**: Processes all miners even if some fail

Test results confirm all scenarios work correctly.

## Expected Outcome

After this fix, the block controller should:

- ✅ Successfully load all miners on every iteration
- ✅ Continue generating blocks every 2 minutes throughout the simulation
- ✅ Handle both new wallet creation (first run) and existing wallet loading (subsequent runs)
- ✅ Skip problematic miners without failing the entire process

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix in a live simulation:

1. Start a new simulation with the updated block controller
2. Monitor the logs to confirm:
   - First block is generated successfully
   - Subsequent blocks are generated at 2-minute intervals
   - All configured miners are loaded on each iteration
3. Check `shadow.data/hosts/block_controller/bash.*.stdout` for successful wallet handling logs

## Additional Improvements

The fix also includes:

- Better error logging with specific error messages
- Graceful handling of edge cases (wallet already loaded, RPC failures)
- Continuation of processing even when individual miners fail
- Clear logging of successful miner additions with truncated addresses

This fix ensures robust block generation throughout the entire simulation duration.
