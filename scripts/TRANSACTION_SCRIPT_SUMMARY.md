# Transaction Script Python Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully created `transaction_script.py` as a Python equivalent for transaction operations in the MoneroSim Shadow network simulation. This script handles wallet creation, address generation, balance checking, and transaction sending between Monero nodes.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Wallet Management**
- `create_or_open_wallet()`: Intelligently creates new wallets or opens existing ones
- Handles both wallet1 (mining wallet) and wallet2 (recipient wallet)
- Robust error handling for wallet initialization failures

### 2. **Address Operations**
- `get_wallet_address()`: Retrieves wallet addresses with retry logic
- Proper error handling for RPC failures
- Clear logging of retrieved addresses

### 3. **Balance Management**
- `wait_for_balance()`: Waits for sufficient balance with configurable timeout
- Supports minimum balance requirements
- Automatic retry with configurable intervals

### 4. **Transaction Handling**
- `send_transaction_with_sweep()`: Sends transactions with automatic dust sweeping
- Handles fragmented inputs (error code -19) gracefully
- Provides detailed transaction information (hash, key, amount, fee)

### 5. **Integration with MoneroSim Framework**
- Uses `error_handling.py` for consistent logging and retry mechanisms
- Uses `network_config.py` for centralized configuration
- Follows MoneroSim coding patterns and conventions

## Improvements Over Original Approach

1. **Better Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error checking at each step
   - Proper retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Clear error messages and logging

2. **Code Organization**
   - Modular functions for each operation
   - Type hints for better code clarity
   - Comprehensive docstrings

3. **Testing**
   - Full unit test coverage (12 tests, all passing)
   - Tests for both success and failure scenarios
   - Integration tests for the main function

## Files Created

1. **`scripts/transaction_script.py`** (313 lines)
   - Main transaction script with all functionality
   - Executable with proper shebang
   - Full integration with MoneroSim modules

2. **`scripts/README_transaction_script.md`** (149 lines)
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Usage instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. **`scripts/test_transaction_script.py`** (241 lines)
   - Complete test suite
   - Mock-based unit tests
   - Integration tests

## Test Results

All 12 tests passed successfully:
- Wallet creation/opening tests
- Address retrieval tests
- Balance checking tests
- Transaction sending tests (including dust sweep)
- Main function integration tests

## Usage

```bash
# Direct execution
./scripts/transaction_script.py

# Within Shadow simulation (configured in shadow.yaml)
# Automatically executed as part of the simulation
```

## Configuration

Uses centralized configuration from `network_config.py`:
- Wallet1: IP 11.0.0.3, Port 28091
- Wallet2: IP 11.0.0.4, Port 28092
- Transaction amount: 0.1 XMR
- Retry attempts: 30
- Retry delay: 2 seconds

## Integration Status

The script is fully integrated with the MoneroSim framework and ready for use in simulations. It maintains compatibility with existing scripts while providing enhanced reliability and maintainability.

## Next Steps

1. Update `shadow.yaml` to use `transaction_script.py` instead of `send_transaction.py` if desired
2. Consider deprecating `send_transaction.py` in favor of this enhanced version
3. Add performance metrics collection for transaction timing analysis
