# Monitor Script Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully created `monitor.py` as a Python replacement for the planned `monitor_script.sh`. The new script provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for Monero nodes in the Shadow simulation.

## Migration Details

### Original Script
- `monitor_script.sh` was mentioned in the architecture documentation but did not exist
- Created `monitor.py` based on the monitoring requirements and patterns from other migrated scripts

### New Python Implementation
- **File**: `scripts/monitor.py`
- **Lines**: 447
- **Executable**: Yes (chmod +x applied)

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - Continuous updates at configurable intervals
   - Clear screen option for dashboard-like display
   - Single-run mode for quick status checks

2. **Comprehensive Metrics**
   - Node status and synchronization state
   - Blockchain height and sync progress
   - Mining status and hashrate
   - Peer connections (incoming/outgoing)
   - Transaction pool status
   - Network difficulty and block rewards

3. **Multi-node Support**
   - Monitor multiple nodes simultaneously
   - Node comparison showing height differences
   - Flexible node configuration via command line

4. **Error Handling**
   - Robust RPC error handling with retries
   - Clear error messages for unreachable nodes
   - Graceful handling of interruptions

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Created `test_monitor.py` with comprehensive test coverage:
- Format functions (size, hashrate)
- NodeStatus class initialization
- Node status updates (success and error cases)
- Print functionality (smoke test)

### Test Results
```
Testing monitor.py functionality...
test_format_hashrate ... ok
test_format_size ... ok
test_node_status_initialization ... ok
test_print_node_status ... ok
test_update_node_status ... ok
test_update_node_status_error ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 6 tests in 6.007s

OK
```

### Integration Testing
- Verified script execution with virtual environment
- Confirmed proper error handling when nodes are not available
- Validated command-line argument parsing

## Usage Examples

### Basic Monitoring
```bash
./scripts/monitor.py
```

### Single Status Check
```bash
./scripts/monitor.py --once
```

### Custom Refresh Rate
```bash
./scripts/monitor.py --refresh 5
```

### Monitor Specific Nodes
```bash
./scripts/monitor.py --nodes A0=http://11.0.0.1:18081/json_rpc A1=http://11.0.0.2:18081/json_rpc
```

### Continuous Logging
```bash
./scripts/monitor.py --no-clear > monitor.log 2>&1
```

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation in `README_monitor.md` including:
- Feature overview
- Usage instructions
- Command-line options
- Example commands
- Troubleshooting guide

## Benefits of Python Implementation

1. **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and retry logic
2. **Type Safety**: Type hints for better code clarity
3. **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns with classes and functions
4. **Testing**: Easy to unit test individual components
5. **Cross-platform**: More portable than bash scripts
6. **Rich Output**: Formatted display with clear organization

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

- Uses `error_handling.py` for logging and RPC calls
- Uses `network_config.py` for network configuration
- Follows the same patterns as other migrated scripts
- Compatible with the virtual environment setup

## Future Enhancements

1. **Graphical Display**: Add ASCII charts for metrics over time
2. **Alerts**: Add threshold-based alerts for critical conditions
3. **Export**: Add data export functionality (CSV, JSON)
4. **Web Interface**: Create a web-based monitoring dashboard
5. **Metrics Collection**: Integration with monitoring systems like Prometheus

## Conclusion

The monitor.py script successfully provides all the monitoring functionality needed for the MoneroSim project. It follows best practices, includes comprehensive error handling, and is well-documented and tested. The Python implementation offers significant advantages over a bash script in terms of maintainability, testability, and functionality.
